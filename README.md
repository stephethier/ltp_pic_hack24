# LTP-PIC

An electrostatic Particle-in-Cell (PIC) code for modeling Low Temperature plasma devices. The code is designed from the ground up to be scalable and provides a base framework from which more advanced physics models can be incorporated. The Readme contains basic details for getting started. For more details on the code see the [Wiki page](https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/ltp_pic/wiki/LTP-PIC).
